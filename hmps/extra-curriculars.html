            <p>In keeping with our belief that education is not only about text books HM Public School offers its students a range of extra-curricular activities to choose from. From adventure sports to music and from skating to gymnastics, students are given ample opportunities to indulge their creative energies. Tours to different locations are undertaken regularly to familiarize students with places of importance, historical or otherwise. Enviorntal Study tours, too, are organized so that students get a feel of nature's pristine glory and thereby learn to respect its sanctity. Various clubs are also present so that students can follow their hobbies and interests fruitfully.</p>
            <p>Boarders are also taught the values of discipline and self-reliance. To develop character, comradeship, secular outlook, spirit of adventure and the ideals of selfless service amongst the youth of the country, the NCC with Army &amp; Navy wings is present in the campus. A sophisticated gymnasium and martial art training ensures that students can keep themselves fit and at the same time learn the value of self-control and humility that different martial arts inculcate.</p>
