It was founded in 1939 by the Bai Kabibai and Hansraj Morarji Trust.

                                At Hansraj Morarji Public School, we firmly believe that for any public school to prosper, the institution has to be a micro world in itself. Our sprawling campus gives us this advantage. From spacious classrooms to specialized labs for different subjects like physics, chemistry, biology, computer science and geography; and comfortable hostel for boys HMPS has it all.
